Fold the top left corner all the way down so it meets the right edge of the paper. (Unfold it, as this will be the guiding crease)
Repeat the same thing with the top right corner and unfold (You should end up with an unfolded sheet with two creases forming an X)
Fold the top right corner down so that its edge meets the crease that goes from top left to bottom right.
Do the same thing with the left corner (the top left point should exactly meet the diagonal right edge of the airplane)
Fold the plane in half on itself, then unfold it (use the middle crease as a guide)
After unfolding (from the previous step), fold the top down so that its edge meets the bottom edge
Fold the top corners down so that their points meet at the middle crease and then unfold it. 
Now take what was the top edge that you previously folded down (step 6) and fold it back up at the point where its edge meets the creases from the previous step 
Fold the corners in yet again (so that their edge meets both the edge of the top flap and crease from Step 7)
Fold the wings in once more (this time simply folding along the crease that you already made. After this step your plane should have straight lines down from the top to the bottom).
Fold the top down from where it meets the top of the wing flaps you created in the previous step. 
Fold the whole thing in half (you want all the paper flaps on the outside of the plane).
Fold the wings down so that their edge meets at the bottom edge of the plane (this creates a small snub nose).
